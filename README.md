## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

* .[NET SDK] 9.0

* Git

* PostgreSQL

#### üìß Email Sending Configuration

**Note:** *This configuration is mandatory for features requiring email (e.g., registration, password reset) to function correctly.*

This application uses Gmail SMTP services. Due to Google's security policies, direct use of your main Google password will fail. You must generate an App Password.

Follow these steps to set up your credentials:

1.  Enable Two-Step Verification (2FA) on your Google Account (this is a prerequisite).

2.  Navigate to the Security settings of your Google Account.

3.  Under "Signing in to Google," generate a new App Password.

4.  Use this generated 16-character App Password as the value for the required SMTP environment variable in your project's configuration ***(appsettings.Development.json)***. 

    **appsettings.Development.json**

        {
          "EmailSettings": {
          "Host": "smtp.gmail.com", // By default, do not change
          "Port": 587, // Standard port for STARTTLS/TLS
          "Username": "youremail@gmail.com",
          "Password": "aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa", // Use App Password
          "FromEmail": "youremail@gmail.com", // It must match the user if you use Gmail.
          "FromName": "Name of your application",
          "EnableSsl": true
          }
        }

#### üõ°Ô∏è Role Seeding & Initialization

This code block runs once during application startup (after database migration, if applicable).

1.  It ensures the security foundation is properly set by: Creating mandatory roles (Admin, User) if they do not exist in the database.

2.  Assigning the Admin role to the hardcoded test email (youremail@gmail.com) to guarantee that an initial administrative user is always available upon first execution.

**ACTION REQUIRED:** If you intend to use a different administrator account for testing, you must update the hardcoded email address in the application's startup code.
